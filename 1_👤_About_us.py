 """
Overall, about 1 in 10 Americans (30 million in total) have some type of liver disease. About 5.5 million people in the U.S. have chronic liver disease or cirrhosis.

Some types of liver disease are becoming more common in the U.S. because they are related to rising rates of obesity. An estimated 20% to 30% of adults have excess fat in their liver, a condition called non-alcohol rekated fatty liver disease (NAFD). This may be renamed metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) to reflect its relationship to metabolic syndrome and conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and obesity.

  * The prediction model provides a binary result indicating whether or not a patient is likely to have liver disease based on the available data and variables. However, it is important to note that it does not provide a probability of developing liver disease.
  
  * The prediction model is based on the available data and variables used in the analysis. There may be other important factors that were not included in the analysis, which could affect the accuracy of the prediction.
  
  * The prediction model is trained based on the data collected. Therefore, accuracy is not fully garanteed.
